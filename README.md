# nm-forms

### What it is.
Angular's reactive forms API reverse engineered for use in vanilla JS apps, supporting 2 way binding, and most of the available methods and properties from the source API.

### The Goal?
None, really) Just to practice object oriented programming with JS, without using any frameworks. To get some hands down experience. A passion project, just for the sake of it. 

### What it is not.
It is not thouroughly tested, it is not complete. It probably won't be published. 

#### It just works ... ðŸ˜‰
