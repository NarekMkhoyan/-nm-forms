## TODO:

1. css classes

2. case - DOM element is added, gets deleted, gets restored | check connection to the DOMWorker

## Stopped at...


POSSIBLE BUG: I check to see if the control is a child of its parent formgroup in the DOM. But I can also have the case of TODO: 2, where the element hasn't been added to the DOM yet.
